# VulkanTutorial-Implementation
My implementation / progress through the Vulkan tutorial at https://vulkan-tutorial.com/

Credits for the tutorial and source go to https://github.com/Overv/VulkanTutorial , and since the original source is licensed under the CC0 1.0 Universal license, this is as well.


The 'chalet.obj' model and 'chalet.jpg' texture referenced in the code can be substituted by any model. I've taken them from https://skfb.ly/HDVU , it is the Chalet Hippolyte Chassande Baroz model by Escadrone. 
(This is also referenced in the Vulkan tutorial ( https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Loading_models )


tinyobjloader ( https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader/ ) is used to load obj files.

stb_image ( https://github.com/nothings/stb ) is used for loading images for texture mapping.
